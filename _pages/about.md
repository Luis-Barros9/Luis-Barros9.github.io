"Hello, I'm Luis, and I was born and raised on the North region of Portugal. From an early age, my primary interests have revolved around video games and sports. As I matured, my curiosity about the inner workings of computers and the internet grew, prompting me to delve deeper into the field. Over time, I've acquired substantial knowledge in programming, but my enthusiasm for further exploration in this exciting domain remains unquenched."
